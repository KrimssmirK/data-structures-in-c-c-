1. What are the advantages of stacks over queues and vice-versa? 
   Write down 3 practical applications of stacks and queues?

The advantages of stacks over queues is that if you deal with the newest data you have to implement stack over queue.
However, if you deal with the oldest data you have to implement queue. They depend on the requirements.

stacks
1. It uses on the allocation of memory like function calls.
2. Converting infix to postfix expressions.
3. It uses on backtracking like maze game to track all paths in order to move back.

queues
1. It uses in the printer to serve data in order. Queue is used to save those requests.
2. For example, in a BPO Company, Call Center. Here, it uses the concept of queues on
    the phone systems to assess people in a line order or what you called FIFO
3. In handling the interruptions on real-time systems. It uses Queues since the interruptions
   that are happening on the system is handled on the same manner or order.

2. What happens if you fill up all the contents of a queue. Can you still add more values?
    Yes, it can. It is possible if you have a dynamic queue.

3. Given that the size of a stack is dynamic, can you put an infinite number of data values into a stack?
    Yes, it can unless you have no capacity of memory.

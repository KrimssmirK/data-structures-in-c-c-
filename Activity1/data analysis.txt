1. What are the practical uses of each decision - making process?
    It is used to change the flow or sequence of algorithms.
2. What is a namespace?
    Namespace allows us to group named entities that otherwise would have global scope
    into narrower scoped, giving them namespace scope. We do not want to write the same code over and over again, because
    it can cause collision to the code.
3. Can a program be compiled without main() function?
    No, it can't since main() function serves as an entry or starting point of the program.
